"""
Cleanlab's Trustworthy Language Model (TLM) is a large language model that gives more reliable answers and quantifies its uncertainty in these answers.

**This module is not meant to be imported and used directly.** Instead, use [`Studio.TLM()`](/reference/python/studio/#method-tlm) to instantiate a [TLM](#class-TLM) object, and then you can use the methods like [`prompt()`](#method-prompt) and [`get_trustworthiness_score()`](#method-get_trustworthiness_score) documented on this page.

The [Trustworthy Language Model tutorial](/tutorials/tlm/) further explains TLM and its use cases.

class TLMOptions(TypedDict):
    """Typed dict containing advanced configuration options for the Trustworthy Language Model.
    Many of these configurations are automatically determined by the quality preset selected
    (see the arguments in the TLM [initialization method](../studio#method-tlm) to learn more about quality presets).
    Specifying custom values here will override any default values from the quality preset.

    For all options described below, higher/more expensive settings will lead to longer runtimes and may consume more tokens internally.
    The high token cost might make it such that you are not able to run long prompts (or prompts with long responses) in your account,
    unless your token limits are increased. If you are hit token limit issues, try using lower/less expensive settings
    to be able to run longer prompts/responses.

    The default values corresponding to each quality preset (specified when instantiating [`Studio.TLM()`](../studio/#method-tlm)) are:
    - **best:** `num_candidate_responses` = 6, `num_consistency_samples` = 8, `use_self_reflection` = True. This preset will improve LLM responses.
    - **high:** `num_candidate_responses` = 4, `num_consistency_samples` = 8, `use_self_reflection` = True. This preset will improve LLM responses.
    - **medium:** `num_candidate_responses` = 1, `num_consistency_samples` = 8, `use_self_reflection` = True.
    - **low:** `num_candidate_responses` = 1, `num_consistency_samples` = 4, `use_self_reflection` = True.
    - **base:** `num_candidate_responses` = 1, `num_consistency_samples` = 0, `use_self_reflection` = False. This preset is equivalent to a regular LLM call.

    By default, the TLM is set to the "medium" quality preset. The default `model` used is "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k", and `max_tokens` is 512 for all quality presets.
    You can set custom values for these arguments regardless of the quality preset specified.

    Args:
        model (str, default = "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"): underlying LLM to use (better models will yield better results).
        Models currently supported include "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k", "gpt-4".

        max_tokens (int, default = 512): the maximum number of tokens to generate in the TLM response.
        This number will impact the maximum number of tokens you will see in the output response, and also the number of tokens
        that can be generated internally within the TLM (to estimate the trustworthiness score).
        Higher values here can produce better (more reliable) TLM responses and trustworthiness scores, but at higher costs/runtimes.
        If you are experiencing token limit errors while using the TLM (especially on higher quality presets), consider lowering this number.
        This parameter must be between 64 and 512.

        num_candidate_responses (int, default = 1): how many alternative candidate responses are internally generated by TLM.
        TLM scores the trustworthiness of each candidate response, and then returns the most trustworthy one.
        Higher values here can produce better (more accurate) responses from the TLM, but at higher costs/runtimes (and internally consumes more tokens).
        This parameter must be between 1 and 20.
        When it is 1, TLM simply returns a standard LLM response and does not attempt to improve it.

        num_consistency_samples (int, default = 8): the amount of internal sampling to evaluate LLM-response-consistency.
        This consistency forms a big part of the returned trustworthiness score, helping quantify the epistemic uncertainty associated with
        strange prompts or prompts that are too vague/open-ended to receive a clearly defined 'good' response.
        Higher values here produce better (more reliable) TLM trustworthiness scores, but at higher costs/runtimes.
        This parameter must be between 0 and 20.

        use_self_reflection (bool, default = `True`): whether the LLM is asked to self-reflect upon the response it
        generated and self-evaluate this response.
        This self-reflection forms a big part of the trustworthiness score, helping quantify aleatoric uncertainty associated with challenging prompts
        and helping catch answers that are obviously incorrect/bad for a prompt asking for a well-defined answer that LLMs should be able to handle.
        Setting this to False disables the use of self-reflection and may produce worse TLM trustworthiness scores, but will reduce costs/runtimes.
