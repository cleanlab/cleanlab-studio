                The "base" preset will not return any trustworthiness score, just a standard LLM response, and is similar to directly using your favorite LLM API.

                Higher presets have increased runtime and cost (and may internally consume more tokens).
                Reduce your preset if you see token-limit errors.
                Details about each present are in the documentation for [TLMOptions](../trustworthy_language_model#class-tlmoptions).
                Avoid using "best" or "high" presets if you primarily want to get trustworthiness scores, and are less concerned with improving LLM responses.
                These presets have higher runtime/cost and are optimized to return more accurate LLM outputs, but not necessarily more reliable trustworthiness scores.

            options (TLMOptions, optional): a typed dict of advanced configuration options.
            Avaialable options (keys in this dict) include "model", "max_tokens", "num_candidate_responses", "num_consistency_samples", "use_self_reflection".
            For more details about the options, see the documentation for [TLMOptions](../trustworthy_language_model#class-tlmoptions).
            If specified, these override any settings from the choice of `quality_preset`.

            timeout (float, optional): timeout (in seconds) to apply to each TLM prompt.
            If a batch of data is passed in, the timeout will be applied to each individual item in the batch.
            If a result is not produced within the timeout, a TimeoutError will be raised. Defaults to None, which does not apply a timeout.

            verbose (bool, optional): whether to print outputs during execution, i.e., whether to show a progress bar when TLM is prompted with batches of data.
            If None, this will be determined automatically based on whether the code is running in an interactive environment such as a Jupyter notebook.
